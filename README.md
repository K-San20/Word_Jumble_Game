# Word_Jumble_Game
Word jumble game made for a data structures project. Uses a hash table to store and search through a dictionary.

!!DON'T RESIZE WINDOW!!

KNOWN ISSUE: Screen flicker due to redrawing every frame for the timer.

This game is essentially like Boggle. Type in a word that uses the jumbled letters and hit enter to confirm, you win the round of you guess the full original word that was jumbled.

ConsoleFunctions.h/c.cpp only code provided to me, rest was written solely by myself.
